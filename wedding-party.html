          <p>Caitlin met Jeannie her Junior year of high school through a mutual friend and they hit it off instantly. Through frequent trips to the lake with her family, never missing a “scene hour” at In n Out, and just spending hours together hanging out, our friendship grew stronger and stronger. Caitlin had the honor of standing by her side on her wedding day and assisting Jeannie during her wedding planning process, they became even closer of friends. Jeannie has been there for Caitlin no matter what and Caitlin is so excited to have Jeannie standing by her side on her wedding day!</p>

          <h1 class="name">Micaela Baral</h1>
          <p>Caitlin was introduced to Micaela through Micaela’s high school boyfriend Junior year of high school. As soon as they were introduced, they were inseparable. The trouble began when Micaela started picking Caitlin up from school and they would dance and sing loudly in the car for all to see and most likely, make fun of. Micaela was even living at Caitlin’s house for a short period of time in high school. Not because she had to but because they really were that close. Micaela has always been like a sister to Caitlin and been there for Caitlin. Through close to ten years of friendship, Caitlin and Micaela have been the closest friends ever and she is so thankful to have Micaela standing by her side on this special day. </p>

          <p>Carly and Caitlin have known each other since they were in the first grade! All through elementary school Caitlin and Carly were hanging out with each other.  Carly was always the sweetest friend who Caitlin could always depend on. In their 20’s they have become even closer of friends with the strongest bond. Carly always gives the greatest advice and is so supportive. Caitlin has no idea what she would do without their semi-weekly girls nights. They can go a few weeks or months even without talking and meet up for dinner and it will be like no time has passed. Having Carly stand by her side is such an honor and she could not be more excited!</p>
