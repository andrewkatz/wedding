  <p>It was October 4, 2014 and Andrew wanted to have a date night. Caity was a little suspicious because normally they both decide on what to do. But, he wanted to surprise her with where it was going to be. Caitlin's birthday was the following week so she started thinking it was a possibly a surprise birthday party. They turned into to Malibu Café at Calamigos Ranch, one of Caitlin's favorite restaurants because of its ambiance. The driveway was beautifully lit with Twinkly lights and chandeliers in the trees. When they arrived, the hostess showed them to a table filled with Caitlin’s close friends who all instantly yelled, “SURPRISE!”</p>

  <p>As soon as Caity arrived, she was convicted it was just a surprise birthday party. She was completely blindsided when Andrew stood up for a toast, began talking about how proud he was of her for her working towards her Master's Degree and how he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He got down on one knee and asked the four words Caity has been anticipating, "Caitlin Marie Faccone, will you marry me?" In the midst of toasting to herself and in complete shock, she said, "YES!"</p>
