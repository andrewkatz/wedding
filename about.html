  <h1>Caitlin</h1>
  <p>Caitlin was born and raised in Agoura Hills, California. She is 25 years old with one older brother. She is very creative and grew up wanting to be an actress. For ten years, Caitlin was in and out of acting classes and auditions.  After deciding to pursue her education, she began taking courses at Moorpark College and obtained her Associates Degree in Liberal Arts. She then transferred to Cal State Channel Islands and received two Bachelors of Arts Degrees in Psychology and Communications with an emphasis in Health. She is now attending Cal Lutheran University working towards a Masters Degree in Counseling Education.</p>

  <p>The night that Caitlin saw Andrew, she was sitting on her bedroom floor thinking she would never find the right person. She was sitting on Facebook, scrolling through her newsfeed and came across a photo and thought, “who is that guy?” She clicked on the photo and sure enough the guy in the photo was tagged. She went to his Facebook page, saw he was single and added him instantly. The following night, at her dad’s studio opening party, she got a notification on her phone that Andrew Katz posted on her wall, “I don’t know you, but you’re cute, so hai.”</p>

  <p>Thanks to Andrew’s post, Caitlin and Andrew’s relationship grew to what it is today.</p>

  <h1>Andrew</h1>
  <p>Andrew was born in Northridge, but grew up in Westlake Village, California with his younger brother, Jake. After graduating high school, Andrew shipped off to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for a degree in Software Engineering. After four short years, he graduated and now spends every day building awesome things.</p>

  <p>After meeting Caity, Andrew knew his life would never be the same. She was so wonderful in every way that he couldn't get enough of her. After dating for over three years, he decided that he never wanted to know life without her, so he picked out the perfect ring and asked her to be his wife.</p>
